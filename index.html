<h2>Reveries of a Programmer</h2>

<p>
I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur; also known as IIT Kanpur. I'm a programmer and a Linux enthusiast.<br>

I'm just an year-old into the serious programmer family, from someone who didn't even know Arrays on coming to college to, well.. someone coding up this whole website from scratch, from not knowing a bit about web development till March, to this, yes my journey has been a fine one.<br>

Being a code-from-scratch guy (perhaps it's partly because I'm lazy to read documentations), I love things like Shell Scripting, but that doesn't mean Python, Node.js, Scala and the likes don't get my love. I've explored a lot about the world of computers, and I'll be sharing new things I come across here in my blog.
