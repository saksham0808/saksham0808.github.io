<p>
A proud sophomore at the Indian <i>Institute of Technology Kanpur</i>, majoring in <i>Computer Science and Engineering</i>.<br>
Throw in ramblings about Linux, Vim, Web Development, and some occassional philosophy; that's about much regarding this blog.<br>
This happens to be the <i>third complete rewrite of my homepage</i>. And I'm not stopping.
<br><br>
As for about me, that's on the <a href="/about.html">About me</a> page.

Some things I'm passionate about (happen to be mostly computers related <i>somehow</i>):
<ul>
  <li> Linux (Gentoo and Arch)</li>
  <li> Text editors (Recently shifted to Emacs, still in love with Vim)</li>
  <li> Cyber security (Hacking ^_^ Not really..)</li>
  <li> Functional Programming (love!)</li>
  <li> Web Development</li>
  <li> Tiling Window Managers (XMonad and i3wm)</li>
  <li> Rambling? (sometimes phrased as 'writing')</li>
</ul>
