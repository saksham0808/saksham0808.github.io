<h2>Reveries of a Programmer</h2>

<p>
A proud sophomore at the Indian <i>Institute of Technology Kanpur</i>, majoring in <i>Computer Science and Engineering</i>.<br>
Throw in ramblings about Linux, Vim, Web Development, and some occassional philosophy; that's about much regarding this blog.<br>
<i>
  This happens to be the third complete rewrite of my homepage. And I'm not stopping.
</i>
<br><br>
Some things I'm passionate about (all happen to be related to Computers <i>somehow</i>):
<ul>
  <li> Linux (Gentoo and Arch)</li>
  <li> Vim (testing out EMACS, but nothing beats Vim)</li>
  <li> Web Development</li>
  <li> Functional Programming (love!)</li>
  <li> Tiling Window Managers (XMonad and i3wm)</li>
  <li> Security (Hacking ^_^ Not really..)</li>
  <li> Rambling? (sometimes phrased as 'writing')</li>
</ul>

<!--I am a sophomore studying Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur; also known as IIT Kanpur. I'm a programmer and a Linux enthusiast.<br>-->

<!--I'm just an year-old into the serious programmer family, from someone who didn't even know Arrays on coming to college to, well.. someone coding up this whole website from scratch, from not knowing a bit about web development till March, to this, yes my journey has been a fine one.<br>-->

<!--Being a code-from-scratch guy (perhaps it's partly because I'm lazy to read documentations), I love things like Shell Scripting, but that doesn't mean Python, Node.js, Scala and the likes don't get my love. I've explored a lot about the world of computers, and I'll be sharing new things I come across here in my blog.-->
