summary: The roads still diverge in the woods..
-------

Of broken roads and trodden paths,  
On these mystical paths they marched.  
What lay ahead, beyond,  
Blissfully unaware.  

Many roads diverged in the woods,  
Which one to choose, the dilemma stood.  
Bewildered, glanced at others,  
Pilgrims who'd been throught it all.  

Myriad counsels, in poured,  
Opening another multitude of doors.  
Follow what your heart says, your core,  
And so went the lore.  

Thrust into these woods they were,  
With nothing to go on and nothing to lose.  
Brains to beat the world,  
They marched ahead.  

Their odyssey, now we embark on,  
They're the pilgrims and we're the voyagers.  
The roads still diverge in the woods,  
And choices we make, make us.
