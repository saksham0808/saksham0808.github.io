AceHack
=======

Source code for my static blog cum website generated using Hakyll (Haskell flavored Jekyll ;) ).
The main code is on the `hakyll` branch of this repository. The master branch contains the built files.

Building and running with Stack:
```
stack setup
stack build
stack exec site watch
```
